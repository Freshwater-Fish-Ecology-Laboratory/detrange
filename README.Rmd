# detrange

## Introduction 

`detrange` estimates detection range from multiple stations within a passive acoustic telemetry array. Under the hood is a Bayesian mixed-effects logistic linear regression model. Each station has a random intercept and slope.

## Demonstration

### Data

`detrange` expects range test data, which must include columns `Station`, `Distance`, `Detects` and `Pings`. `Pings` is the expected number of detections. An example dataset `range_test` is included for reference.

```{r data}
library(detrange)
library(jmbr)

### view example dataset
data <- range_test
data
```

### Analysis
Detection range is modelled using `dr_analyse`. It is possible for the user to set their own priors. If the model fails to converge, increase the value of `nthin`.
```{r}
analysis <- dr_analyse(data, nthin = 1L)
```
With the analysis object, view various summary tables and plots, including the detection range midpoint estimates and confidence intervals. 

```{r}
### coefficient table
dr_analysis_coef(analysis)
```
```{r}
### get midpoint estimates
dr_analysis_midpoint(analysis)
```

```{r}
### plot predicted values
dr_plot_predicted(analysis)
```
