Readme/justification
- sensible default priors based on literature
- reference to gold standard range testing methods (and why pkg works for that)

Issues/fixes
- double check term descriptions
- rename midpoint (model terms + priors + analysis_midpoint fun name)
- add de to midpoint table
- colect a set of sensible priors for detection range in different environments (river, lake, ocean)

Enhancements
- pass de_target through model
- add CI levels (e.g. 95%, etc.)
- flexible point estimate as argument? (e.g. mean, median)
- pass vector of de_target
- function to plot posteriors of distance estimates?
- account for nested station/transect (i.e. directions at single station)
- add legend to plot
- implement correlated slope/intercept model
- build shiny app
- put on CRAN

Pkg maintenance stuff
- build website
- set up GH actions and badge
- add lifecycle badges
- add test coverage

Tutorials
- run basic analysis using range test data
- run analysis coping with CPDI (i.e. quadratic relationship)
- use detrange to simulate hypothetical DR or known DR reported in other studies (i.e. no data all priors)

Implement with TMB
- option for fixed or random effects
- fixed effects should be used if <5 stations
Why use random effects? if one station has limited data it will be helped by data from other stations
- in case of lower detection efficiency at close distance due to CPDI (i.e. a n-shaped curve), should fit two models (one with breakpoint) and use AIC to select the best model - or model average for estimates.
- Use tidyverse funs from generics for model object manipulation - glance, tidy, augment, predict
