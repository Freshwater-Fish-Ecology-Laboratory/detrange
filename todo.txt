package/function names
- rename to drtools? this works better for possibility of package suite eg. drdata, drshiny, drsim

Readme/articles
- reference to gold standard range testing methods (and why pkg works for that)
- move detailed readme sections into articles for website (only include simple call to dr_fit and installation)
- articles
  - getting started with detrange (includes background)
  - doing more with detrange
    - changing priors
    - working with samples/model objects

Issues/fixes
- double check term descriptions

Enhancements
- function to plot posteriors of distance estimates?
- model for nested station/transect (i.e. cardinal directions at single station)
- model for CPDI - lower detection efficiency at close distance due to CPDI (i.e. a n-shaped curve), should fit two models (one with breakpoint) and use AIC to select the best model - or model average for estimates.
- add legend to plot
- implement correlated slope/intercept model
- build shiny app
- put on CRAN
- Use tidyverse funs from generics for model object manipulation - glance, tidy, augment, predict
- link to funs in documentation
- make priors and terms accessible to user - data-raw

Pkg maintenance stuff
- build website
- set up GH actions and badge
- add lifecycle badges
- add test coverage

Tutorials
- run basic analysis using range test data
- run analysis coping with CPDI (i.e. quadratic relationship)
- use detrange to simulate hypothetical DR or known DR reported in other studies (i.e. no data all priors)

Implement with TMB
- option for fixed or random effects
- fixed effects should be used if <5 stations

ssdtools
generics - glance, tidy, augment, predict
basic TMB r package wrapper - tutorial - made a packge how to do it
warn user if
