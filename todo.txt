package/function names
- rename to drtools? this works better for possibility of package suite eg. drdata, drshiny, drsim

Readme/articles
- reference to gold standard range testing methods (and why pkg works for that)
- move detailed readme sections into articles for website (only include simple call to dr_fit and installation)
- articles
  - getting started with detrange (includes background)
  - doing more with detrange
    - working with dr_template - changing priors, param names etc.
    - working with samples/model objects

Issues/fixes
- get edu/joe to look over term descriptions
- get edu/joe to look over fixed-effect model and coef table

Enhancements
- function to plot posteriors of distance estimates?
- model for nested station/transect (i.e. cardinal directions at single station)
- model for CPDI - lower detection efficiency at close distance due to CPDI (i.e. a n-shaped curve), should fit two models (one with breakpoint) and use AIC to select the best model - or model average for estimates.
- add legend to plot
- implement correlated slope/intercept model
- build shiny app
- put on CRAN
- Use generics for model object manipulation - some ideas:
  - glance (summary of model performance/convergence) - Construct a single row summary "glance" of a model, fit, or other object - glance methods always return either a one-row data frame
  - augment (get underlying data back) - A tibble::tibble() with information about data points
  - explore (run shiny app/widget on object) invokes a function that starts an interactive, pre-defined widget (e.g. plotly visualization, shiny app, etc.) to investigate the results.
  - tidy (maybe get coef estimates?) - Turn an object into a tidy tibble
  - visualize (maybe plot? or use autoplot?) - Visualize a data set or object.
  - fit (maybe fit model? but would have to add class to data, or compile mdoel first - seems unnecessary step) - Estimates parameters for a given model from a set of data.
- link to funs in documentation
- expose priors and terms to user - data-raw - to allow easily changing priors and seeing which terms will be in a given model
- add dr_template function to build model without sampling so user can see it and adjust priors/terms - remove priors argument from dr_fit?
- method for dr_fit - data.frame vs drtemplate class

Pkg maintenance stuff
- build website
- set up GH actions and badge
- add lifecycle badges
- add test coverage

Tutorials
- run basic analysis using range test data
- run analysis coping with CPDI (i.e. quadratic relationship)
- use detrange to simulate hypothetical DR or known DR reported in other studies (i.e. no data all priors)

Implement with TMB
- option for fixed or random effects
- fixed effects should be used if <5 stations

ssdtools
generics - glance, tidy, augment, predict
basic TMB r package wrapper - tutorial - made a packge how to do it
warn user if
