### for joe
1. is it good idea to use JAGS? i.e. easy for people to install on their machine? STAN would be harder? what about TMB - I think using something that makes installation easier might be better

2. Why is midpoint model so sensitive to priors? sensible default priors?

3. what do you think best way of accepting user priors?

4. If I add parameter descriptions, can these be seen in coefficient table?

5. should i include slope term estimates as well as midpoint?

6. Is it good idea to provide wrappers on basic mbr funs eg glance and coef? only reason might be good is that there is no user-friendly documentation for mbr - so might be nice to repackage to make obvious what can be done

7. is there a way to pass the de_target through the model so user doesnt have to specify again in plot fun

### for me/ further research
1. default priors should essentially capture what is expected by the manufacturer under 'stanard' conditions - i.e. 100% DE at 0m and max_range of 500m? what would be the expected slope and midpoint?

2. should we build functionality for multiple directions within singel station - is this a nested mixed-effects model? or does user simply need to give each transect a unique station name?
