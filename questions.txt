### for me/ further research
1. default priors should essentially capture what is expected by the manufacturer under 'standard' conditions - i.e. 100% DE at 0m and max_range of 500m? what would be the expected slope and midpoint?

2. should we build functionality for multiple directions within singel station - is this a nested mixed-effects model? or does user simply need to give each transect a unique station name?

3. Should we allow for a model with low DE at close distance (i.e. CPDI; Kessler 2015) in n-shape curve.
we could model both and test best model on the data by AIC or model average estimates.

4. only allow random effects with >5 stations?

might need to allow users to include quadratic term so taht can account for CPDI - see
