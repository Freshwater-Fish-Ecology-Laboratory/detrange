### use nimble?
- better support for simulation
- maybe can mimic jags by setting slice samplers - nimble not good at guessing init values on vague priors though
- users would have to download compiler and tools if not there: https://r-nimble.org/download
- c++ compilation time - need to check whether can pre-compile as in STAN

### for me/ further research
1. should default priors capture what is expected by the manufacturer under 'standard' conditions - or rather should they be uninformative. in initial exploration using uninformative priors works best - as informative priors may yield unexpected results.

2. should we build functionality for multiple directions within singel station - is this a nested mixed-effects model? or does user simply need to give each transect a unique station name? if yes, should the degree (compass direction) of the transect be taken into account or should they simpy be used to estimate a 'typical' transect from each station? (this amtters e.g. when visualizing or creating a 'detection range zone' - i.e. as convex hull rather than circle)

3. Should we allow for a model with low DE at close distance (i.e. CPDI; Kessler 2015) in n-shape curve.
we could model both and test best model on the data by AIC or model average estimates.

4. should i standradize distance covariate?

for joe:

## coef reporting
should i report svalue in tidy() and predict() funs?

## plotting
should autoplot method for drfit object simply plot observed data or should it automatically generate predictions (takes a few seconds)?

## seed
how best to pass a seed into rjags and via several functions (e.g. dr_simulate)

## accepting null/character(0)
thoughts on accepting NULL/character(0) for function args and then doing if/else? (e.g. estimates function in universals)

## package names
is it better to have a 'suite' of R packages rather than one giant one to reduce dependencies? (i.e. shiny, eventually some kind fo simulation packages) - does this make it harder to publish? does it maek harder to document in articles/vignettes? i.e. one website for all to show workflows that use several packages?
does it maek sense to have one overarching package (drtools) to load/install them all?

## movement simulation
for movement simulation - should i use SiMRiv r package or use it as inspirationa dn build my own simulation functions to reduce dependencies?
simriv is a bit overkill - as we dont need multiple values of landscape resistance - only need 0 (water) and 1 (land)
simriv downsides
- depnds on raster and sp rather than sf and stars
- frequentist
- movement parameters approximated using 'heuristic approximation method' - not comparable to ML
If we can build a JAGS model to do the same thing, we can use sims package to simulate data
alternative is to use momentuHMM, but would prefer to code myself for dependency/flexibility reasons?

## ssdtools review
why prefix some functions with .?
why put ... + chk_unused(...) at end of method functions
can autoplot take function arguments?
