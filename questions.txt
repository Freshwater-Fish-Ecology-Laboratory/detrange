### for me/ further research
1. should default priors capture what is expected by the manufacturer under 'standard' conditions - or rather should they be uninformative. in initial exploration using uninformative priors works best - as informative priors may yield unexpected results.

2. should we build functionality for multiple directions within singel station - is this a nested mixed-effects model? or does user simply need to give each transect a unique station name?

3. Should we allow for a model with low DE at close distance (i.e. CPDI; Kessler 2015) in n-shape curve.
we could model both and test best model on the data by AIC or model average estimates.

should i report svalue in tidy() and predict() funs?

should autoplot method for drfit simply fit observed data or should it automatically generated predictions?

ssdtools review
why prefix some functions with .?
do you save all function args as attributes? useful for reporting later?
why put ... + chk_unused(...) at end of method functions
