### for me/ further research
1. should default priors capture what is expected by the manufacturer under 'standard' conditions - or rather should they be uninformative. in initial exploration using uninformative priors works best - as informative priors may yield unexpected results.

2. should we build functionality for multiple directions within singel station - is this a nested mixed-effects model? or does user simply need to give each transect a unique station name?

3. Should we allow for a model with low DE at close distance (i.e. CPDI; Kessler 2015) in n-shape curve.
we could model both and test best model on the data by AIC or model average estimates.

for joe:

should i report svalue in tidy() and predict() funs?

should autoplot method for drfit simply plot observed data or should it automatically generate predictions (takes a few seconds)?

ssdtools review
why prefix some functions with .?
why put ... + chk_unused(...) at end of method functions
can autoplot take function arguments?
