### for joe
1. is it good idea to use JAGS? i.e. easy for people to install on their machine? STAN would be harder? what about TMB - I think using something that makes installation easier might be better

2. How to specify any point not jsut midpoint?

3. what do you think best way of accepting user priors?

### for me/ further research
1. default priors should essentially capture what is expected by the manufacturer under 'stanard' conditions - i.e. 100% DE at 0m and max_range of 500m? what would be the expected slope and midpoint?
