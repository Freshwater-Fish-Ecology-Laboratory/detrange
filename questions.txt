### for me/ further research
1. should default priors capture what is expected by the manufacturer under 'standard' conditions - or rather should they be uninformative. in initial exploration using uninformative priors works best - as informative priors may yield unexpected results.

2. should we build functionality for multiple directions within singel station - is this a nested mixed-effects model? or does user simply need to give each transect a unique station name?

3. Should we allow for a model with low DE at close distance (i.e. CPDI; Kessler 2015) in n-shape curve.
we could model both and test best model on the data by AIC or model average estimates.

4. only allow random effects with >5 stations?

5. Which generics should I use?
difference between meaning of glance generic in mbr vs ssdtools

6. Should i rename to drtools in anticipation of related pkgs (e.g. drdata, drshiny)
